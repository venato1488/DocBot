Introduction and Purpose of the Software:

The purpose of this software is to generate technical documentation from source code written in Java or Python using natural language processing skills. The software aims to analyze the code and maintain up-to-date documentation to ensure product quality. It utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to generate the technical documentation.

Prerequisites and Installation Instructions:

Before running the software, ensure that Python version 3 or above is installed on the system. Additionally, the following Python packages are required:

- openai
- tenacity

These packages can be installed through pip using the following command:

pip install openai tenacity

Getting Started:

To use the software, follow the steps below:

1. Open the command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory containing the source code to be documented.

2. Run the software using the following command:

python docbot.py input_directory [-l LEVEL] [-f FORMAT]

Replace input_directory with the path to the directory containing the source code.

The -l flag specifies the level of detail for the generated documentation, which can be set to high-level, intermediate, or detailed. The default value is intermediate.

The -f flag specifies the format of the generated documentation, which can be set to markdown or html. The default value is markdown.

3. The software will analyze the source code and generate the technical documentation in the specified format.

In-Depth Explanation of the Software's Architecture, Modules, and Design Patterns:

The software consists of several modules, including:

- file_handler: contains functions for reading and processing files in the input directory.
- minifiers: contains functions for minifying Java and Python code.
- docbot: the main module, which handles the user interface and communicates with the OpenAI API to generate the technical documentation.

The software utilizes the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model to generate the technical documentation. It reads the source code in the input directory, processes it using the minifiers module, and sends it to the OpenAI API to generate the documentation in the specified format.

In-Production Usage Guides with Best Practices and Troubleshooting Tips:

Best practices for using the software include ensuring that the source code in the input directory is up-to-date and organized, using meaningful variable and function names, and providing clear comments and documentation within the code.

If the software fails to generate the documentation, ensure that the correct path to the input directory is specified, and that the source code is written in either Java or Python.

Real-World Use Cases, Illustrating How the Software Can Be Applied in Various Scenarios:

The software can be applied in various scenarios, such as:

- Software development companies can use the software to generate technical documentation from their source code, which can be useful for internal and external purposes.
- Freelance developers can use the software to save time and effort when creating technical documentation for their clients.
- Educational institutions can use the software to generate documentation for educational purposes, such as teaching programming concepts.
